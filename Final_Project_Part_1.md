# How digitally advanced are the public libraries in Pittsburgh?

## Outline

### Project Summary

Digital transformation is of vital importance for contemporary libraries. The Library of Congress prioritizes digital strategy as the library's strategic plan, aiming to expand access, enhance services, optimize resources, and measure results. (Library of Congress, 2019). The advantages of transformation include improvement of resource access and information searching efficiency, protection of cultural relics, support for academic research, reduction of maintenance costs, and improvement of information sharing. In general, the digitization of libraries has provided more efficient, convenient, and sustainable knowledge services for the information society, promoting the development of culture, education, and research.

Do libraries in Pittsburgh perform better than the national average? This project will explore the current status of regional libraries in various aspects of digital transformation from the library's perspective and from the user's perspective. 

From the library perspective, I will focus on how much attention they pay to digital transformation: 

1. How many new electric versions of content(Ebooks, audio, video) they collect each year

2. The electronic materials expenditures(Ratio to the total expenditures, absolute value) 

3. Digital infrastructure(Website, WiFi access, digital reference system)

From the user perspective, I will focus on how users respond to the digital transformation:

1. The Number of website visitors.

2. The amount of digital content downloaded.

3. Electronic library cards issued
