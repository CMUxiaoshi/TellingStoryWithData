# How digitally advanced are the public libraries in Pittsburgh?

## Outline

### Project Summary

Digital transformation is of vital importance for contemporary libraries. The Library of Congress prioritizes digital strategy as the library's strategic plan, aiming to expand access, enhance services, optimize resources, and measure results. (Library of Congress, 2019). The advantages of transformation include improvement of resource access and information searching efficiency, protection of cultural relics, support for academic research, reduction of maintenance costs, and improvement of information sharing. In general, the digitization of libraries has provided more efficient, convenient, and sustainable knowledge services for the information society, promoting the development of culture, education, and research.

In this project, I will not only analyze the overall digital trend across the country, but also compare local public library to the national average level. What perspectvie do local library performe better? What do not? After the analysis, I will also provide brief policy suggestions for library in Pittsburgh to performe better. 

The Analysis mainly focus on two perspective: library perspective and user perspective. More details list in the data section.

## The data

Data Source: [Public Library Association PLA Servey and Data](https://www.imls.gov/research-evaluation/data-collection/public-libraries-survey)
They provides csv files from 2005-2021. I some of variables in these csv to createplot, inluding: 

From the library perspective, I will focus on how much attention they pay to digital transformation: 

1. How many new electric versions of content(Ebooks, audio, video) they collect each year

2. The electronic materials expenditures(Ratio to the total expenditures, absolute value) 

3. Digital infrastructure(Website, WiFi access, digital reference system)

From the user perspective, I will focus on how users respond to the digital transformation:

1. The Number of website visitors.

2. The amount of digital content downloaded.

3. Electronic library cards issued

## Method and Medium
I'm using iPad to help me sketch my drafts. Data were viewed through Excel. ChatGPT was used for outline building.
