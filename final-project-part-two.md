# User research
Target audience
Include your approach to identifying representative individuals, and who you hope to reach with your story.

My targets are people within library industry such as library policy makers, library owners and employees, and people who frequently visit libraries. Audients may have already noticed that running library is expensive, especially after the pandemic, or suffered from the difficulties of borrowing e-version of books from library. They do not need to understand anything about digital transformation because that is not the point I want to discuss in detail in the story. What I want to underscore is that library should seize the oppotunites provides by the pandemic and finish the digital transformation, which benefits everyone. Thus, this report is more like an evidence supporting the idea that library should transform as soon as possible and this can be a resolution as problems mentioned above.

# Interview script

| Goal | Question to Ask |
| :----: | :----: |
| Engagement | Who's the possible audience of this report? |
| Understanding | Is the logic of the story OK to you? | 
| Clarity | Any visualization confuse you? |
| Aesthetic | Which one of the figure you like the most? Why or why not? |
| General Improvement | Any other points need to improve?|

# Interview findings

| Feedback number| Interview 1 (Female, 20s) | Interview 2 (Male, 20s) | Interview 3 (Female, 20s) |
| :----: | :----: | :----: | :----: |
| 1 | This report is useful for me because I like to borrow digital books from library. I really think library should improve their online service and provide more e-books! The total logic is OK for me. But the title of the report is kind of confuse as it does not point out what opportunity that the pandemic provided.| Total logic is fine. But the defination of the library seems to be redundant.| The title of the whole report as well as the title of each part seems confuse to me. Overall logic is OK.|
| 2 | The color of the line chart does not match other graph's color | The title of each axis is not specific show in the graph, I can only find relavent information in the chart description and the title of graph | Figure 3 seems a little bit confused to me as the first time span is 10 years while the second time span is 9 years. Can you make it all the same? |
| 3 | I think the description for the first two figures are also mentioned in the first part of your report, is this kind of redudant? | The font size of each topics seems different, though I think these topics are on the same level. You probably need to change that. | Remember to check grammar and sentences.|
| 4 | The size of figure 1 and figure 2 are not the same. | 

# Identified changes for Part III
1. Improve some of the graphs. Change the color to make all graph use the same type of color pattern. Add axis labels.
2. Unify the font size for each titles
3. Check and delete redundant descriptions in the report, correct grammer mistakes
4. Check all time span and unify them.
5. Other details such as the size of figures.

# Final Thoughts
Generally, the logic story is ok, but a lot of details need to be improved. Also, probably in the final project I will use other visualization tools rather than excel.
