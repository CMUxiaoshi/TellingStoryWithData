# Critique of the data visualization
Advantage: 
Intuitiveness: the audience is easy to know what the chart is representing and what the data is. 
Disadvantages: 
Usefulness: the author only provided a visualization without further explanation. It’s not clear why the author wants to illustrate this, and the audience is uncertain. It would be better if the author explained the impact of the production changed. 
Completeness: the author seems to present the change of production over time as well. However, the author uses a dynamic bar chart to present this point. The x-axis changes over time, but the length of the bar chart does not change, which might confuse the audience.
Perceptibility: The background, colors, and national flags are all distracting. The title of this video underscores “the most” so probably it’s better to highlight the top 1 country and gently ignore others. However, the author underscores the top 10 countries here, which is also distracting.
Truthfulness: If only looking at data at a single time point, the data presentation appears relatively reliable. However, when considering the trend changes, since the x-axis is constantly changing, it becomes challenging for the audience to compare production levels at different time points.
Aesthetics: the background of this video is distracting. Too many colors in the graph.
Engagement: I don’t understand what could inspire the audience to learn more about the topic. This visualization seems to only present the facts but does not provide any further information. 

# Scratch and test the solution

What do we want to talk about in this viz?

The change in tomato productions over time for each countries/for the whole world. Which countries now have the highest production?

Who are our audience?

I think the audience might be people who is interested in agriculture development such as historians, economists, civil servants and college students. Thus, I think it's better to include some tags or explainations of this visualization to show how these data can help people above. For example, for policy maker, they can quickly find out which country has the highest production in tomato. Later, they can search policy of that countries of encouraging agriculture development faster. The origial visualization is posted on Linkedin, a tag can quickly attract people who are interesting in this data.

How can we create the viz?
Highlight the first countries, show the trend over time. Add a brief description after the graph.

I'm also thinking of redesigning the pie graph in the original graph.

## Student, 23
- Can you tell me what you think this is?

It is about which countries yield the most tomatoes and how tomato production increases over time.

- Can you describe to me what this is telling you?

In 2021, China is the world's largest tomato-producing country. Tomato yield increased a lot. 

- Is there anything you find surprising or confusing?

The number decimal are different in your scratch. Also I think I can figure out the approximated ratio without the pie chart. Thus the pie chart is kind of confused for me. 

- Who do you think is the intended audience for this?

Economists.

- Is there anything you would change or do differently?

For me, I probably investigate the consumption per person of tomatoes as well.

## Adult, 45

- Can you tell me what you think this is?

The production of tomatoes with its trend.

- Can you describe to me what this is telling you?

China is now the biggest tomato producer. The sum of production from the top 2 to top 10 countries is less than the production of China.

- Is there anything you find surprising or confusing?

We produce so many tomatoes nowadays! But this graph can't tell me whether all countries produce more tomatoes over time. 

- Who do you think is the intended audience for this?

Agricultural economists? Probably people just want to know this for fun.

- Is there anything you would change or do differently?

If I were you, I want to present the change in each country's yield.

## What I Have Learned from the Video

The video address: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJNGnAkykK4
The author of the video put four graphs in his dashboard: Three graphs at the top of the dashboard present the change in harvested, production, and yield. It seems he has extra data sources and did further research. On the bottom of his dashboard, he just put the change in rank of each country into a line chart. Users can use filters on the right to choose the country they want to highlight. This is a good way to present the change in each country compared to the original videos. He generally eliminates the impact of change in the x-axis and makes the comparison clear. You can not only compare the yield of top 10 countries but also compare the yield of countries all over the world. However, personally speaking, I don't think it's a good idea to put all countries on the same graph. The final graph is composed of hundreds of lines that intersect with each other.  

## In class Feed Back

The graph is intuitive and clear overall.
However, it should have a big title on the top of the graph and only use one title. 
The pie chart is confused, you should delete it or make more specific explaination.
You should use the same decimal places for all data.
One data source is enouth.

(Brief Description) The whole world produce more tomatoes than ever. This graph shows the top 10 tomato producers. Do they use unique techniques or policy to boost their agriculture?

I chose a green-gray color pair to highlight the biggest tomato producer. In the original context, I think the author wants to underscore "the biggest". Thus, in my graph, I use gray to gently ignore other countries. At the bottom of the graph, I put a line of production to describe the change trend. Compared to the original figure, this provides the audience a better understanding of how much tomato we create today. The brief explaination inspire audience for further thinking. (Probably I could place some link here for reference). The graph in the bottom could be better if I can show yield change in tomato production for each countries. To avoid the mess that is similar to the one in the video, I think it's better to use a filter and only show graph of the country that user choose, or several countries (less than ten) as the same time. However, due to the time limit, I'm still working on Tableau for how to add such a filter.
