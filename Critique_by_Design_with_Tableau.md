# Critique of the data visualization
Advantage: 
Intuitiveness: the audience is easy to know what the chart is representing and what the data is. 
Disadvantages: 
Usefulness: the author only provided a visualization without further explanation. It’s not clear why the author wants to illustrate this, and the audience is uncertain. It would be better if the author explained the impact of the production changed. 
Completeness: the author seems to present the change of production over time as well. However, the author uses a dynamic bar chart to present this point. The x-axis changes over time, but the length of the bar chart does not change, which might confuse the audience.
Perceptibility: The background, colors, and national flags are all distracting. The title of this video underscores “the most” so probably it’s better to highlight the top 1 country and gently ignore others. However, the author underscores the top 10 countries here, which is also distracting.
Truthfulness: If only looking at data at a single time point, the data presentation appears relatively reliable. However, when considering the trend changes, since the x-axis is constantly changing, it becomes challenging for the audience to compare production levels at different time points.
Aesthetics: the background of this video is distracting. Too many colors in the graph.
Engagement: I don’t understand what could inspire the audience to learn more about the topic. This visualization seems to only present the facts but does not provide any further information.
