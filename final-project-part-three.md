# The final data story
<script src="https://xiao-shi.shorthandstories.com/96ff1be4-9304-450a-9d8c-d902ccdc59d6/embed.js"></script>


# Changes made since Part II
Change the titles of each part to make the logic clear. 
Add a title and a simple explanation for graphs.
Redesign some of the graphs to improve their aesthetics.


At the same time, I rewrote some segments to enhance the logic of the overall story. When this story was first constructed, the logic didn't quite flow as well as it does now.

# The audience
Policymaker, library manager. This data visualization is based on an operation perspective, mainly providing advice for people who run libraries. 
However, individuals who are interested in libraries can also understand the report easily as the content is not complex nor filled up with terminologies.

# Final design decisions

When I made the first part, I didn't have a clear storyline, so my first part was a bit confusing, or rather, it was a visualization for the sake of visualization. This creates difficulties in understanding and unclear reporting purposes. This confusion also hurt me. It was difficult for me to sort out a coherent logic and choose an appropriate visualization method for visualization in the first part. So after the end of the first part, I deeply observed and thought about the possible stories of this data.

In the second part, since the logic has been sorted out, it is only necessary to select the appropriate visualization. Through selection, I think there is no need to choose more complicated visualization methods. Simple methods such as line charts and bar charts can effectively reflect trends, stocks, gaps, and other data. Therefore, in my second draft, all graphs are described using simple bar charts or stick charts drawn in Excel.

The last improvement is to make it more suitable for display. Due to the one-minute limit, my story logic needed to be tighter and my title should be more concise. Since the graphs drawn in excel lack titles, horizontal and vertical coordinate titles, and other content that is helpful for readers to read, I chose to return to these graphs and emphasis to deepen the readers' memory and strengthen the logic of the story.

# Final thoughts
The most important thing about data visualization is telling the story behind it, not the visualization. Visualization should serve the story. If there is no story, it will be difficult to choose a suitable visualization method. Even if the data is visualized, it will be difficult to obtain effective information through images. These are the most valuable things I learned during this project. A rich database may help you practice machine learning or statistical skills, but it is very difficult to directly assign a data set to you and ask you to visualize it. Therefore, the data set does not exist alone. In future data processing, I should regard the data as a kind of evidence, or the support of the story, rather than the protagonist of the story. Only such visualizations are meaningful and can be understood by readers or listeners.

The most important thing when choosing visual graphics is that they are easy to understand. It is not enough for the author to know the meaning of the graphics. After all, visualization is to serve other people in need. If the graphics are so complex that only the author can understand them, the visualization will undoubtedly fail. Therefore, in this report, I try to use the most understandable data display method for visualization.

Of course, the theme selection of visual content is also very important. A good theme means that you can remember it, but a clear but weak theme will hardly leave a deep impression on people. In class, a classmate showed that eating McDonald's can still keep people healthy. This topic is very interesting (at least compared to me) and very interesting. Therefore, inspiration is also essential for visualization. As mentioned earlier, data serves the story. Only when the story is exciting can visualization serve as the icing on the cake.
